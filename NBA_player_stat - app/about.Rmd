## Purpose

The purpose of this shiny app project is to provide a platform for NBA fans and enthusiasts to explore and analyze the statistical performance of NBA players during the 2021-2022 regular season. By creating interactive visualizations through render charts, the app allows users to gain insights into individual player statistics such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and other important metrics that help to measure player performance and team success. This project aims to provide a useful tool for fans, coaches, analysts, and other stakeholders in the basketball community to understand the key factors contributing to player success and ultimately team success in the NBA.
